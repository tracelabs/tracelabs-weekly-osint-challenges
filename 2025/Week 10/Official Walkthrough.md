Objective

Trace Labs is hosting a secret event and has provided a cryptic code instead of a traditional address:
```complains.bowls.fantastic```

The task is to decode the message and identify the location.

Tools Used

Google — reconnaissance and contextual discovery

what3words — decoding the three-word location

Google Maps / Street View — geographic confirmation

----

Step 1: Initial Reconnaissance

Begin by searching each word individually:

complains

bowls

fantastic

No meaningful geographic or contextual information is returned.

Key Observation

The words are not descriptive and appear unrelated. This strongly suggests the phrase is encoded, not literal.

---

Step 2: Contextual Search

Next, search the entire string together:

This immediately surfaces results related to what3words.

OSINT Insight

Random words separated by periods are a strong indicator of the what3words addressing system.

---

Step 3: Decode the Three-Word Address

Navigate to what3words and enter:

```complains.bowls.fantastic```

The system resolves the address to a precise 3m × 3m location, identifying:

Merlion Park

This provides a highly specific geographic result.

---

Step 4: Geographic Verification

Open Google Maps and search for Merlion Park.

Verification confirms:

The location is in Singapore

It is a well-known public landmark

The precision aligns with what3words’ design

Using Street View further confirms:

The iconic Merlion statue

Open, accessible public space

Clear pedestrian access suitable for a meetup

All evidence corroborates the decoded location.

Final Answer: Merlion Park, Singapore
