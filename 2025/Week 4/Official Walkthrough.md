**Step 1: Reverse Image Search**
<img width="1595" height="908" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-03 122843" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd45bea9-1bb4-4364-b63e-ed2bf03de35e" />


Begin by uploading the photo to images.google.com.

The skyline appears generic at first: dense urban towers, reflective surfaces, and numerous high-rise buildings. To narrow it down, focus on unique architectural features rather than the entire skyline.

One structure stands out — a building with a distinctive diamond-shaped rooftop.
Using this feature, reverse image search results point toward the Crain Communications Building.

This provides a strong initial lead.

**Step 2: Identify Key Landmarks**
<img width="1527" height="724" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-03 122955" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bad6dfbf-6636-41db-85fd-3696b8c45b10" />

Search for Crain Communications Building in Google Maps.

Review nearby structures and compare them with the image:

Shape of the ridge lines on adjacent buildings

Skyline composition

Lakefront visibility

These elements strongly resemble the challenge image.

**Step 3: Perspective Confirmation (Google Maps)**
<img width="1699" height="706" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-03 123208" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/238e2daa-5238-459a-8771-cce96f158af4" />


Switch to 3D mode and Street View to validate the camera angle.

Move the Street View camera to viewpoints along the waterfront.
Adjust position until the skyline aligns with the challenge image.
Key matching indicators include:

The diamond-shaped rooftop of the Crain Communications Building

Surrounding skyscrapers matching position and height

Light reflections and building spacing similar to the original image

**Step 4: Replicate the Photo**
<img width="1884" height="894" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-03 123714" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a2458dc-83b2-49a9-8032-3933f1a3439a" />



Fine-tune the perspective by adjusting zoom and angle within Street View.

Once aligned, the skyline configuration confirms the identification:

Same rooftop geometry

Matching building arrangement

Corresponding lakefront background

The location matches the real skyline with high confidence.

**Final Answer**

Chicago Skyline, Illinois, USA
