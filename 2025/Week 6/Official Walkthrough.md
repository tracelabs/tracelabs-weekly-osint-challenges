**Question:**
What airport did Elon Musk’s private jet (Tail Number: N628TS) land at on September 19, 2025?

**Tools Used**

X (Twitter) — initial social media intelligence and claims

ADS-B Exchange — raw aircraft telemetry and historical flight data

Google Earth — geospatial visualization and route confirmation

**Step 1: Initial Research (Search and Social Media)**

The investigation begins with the provided tail number: N628TS.

A general web search for the aircraft surfaces multiple discussions related to Elon Musk’s private jet, including posts from well-known jet-tracking community accounts commonly referred to as ElonJet.

A post dated September 19 claimed that the aircraft landed in Austin, Texas.

While this is a strong lead, OSINT best practice applies:

Social media is a clue — not a conclusion.

Independent verification is required.

**Step 2: Dead End and Pivot**

The referenced source TheAirTraffic.com was reviewed but did not provide sufficient confirmation for this specific flight.

Key OSINT lesson:
Dead ends are not failures — they are signals to pivot.

At this point, the investigation shifts to a more reliable source of raw flight data.

**Step 3: Aircraft Tracking with ADS-B Exchange**

ADS-B Exchange was selected because it:

Provides raw, uncensored ADS-B telemetry

Supports historical flight replay

Allows export of flight paths in KML format

Using ADS-B Exchange:

Navigate to the historical data for September 19, 2025

Confirm flight activity on that date

Export the flight path as a KML file
