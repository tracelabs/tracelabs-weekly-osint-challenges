**Step 1: Reverse Image Search**

Upload the challenge photo to images.google.com.
<img width="1486" height="701" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-25 102256" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d85c3159-2425-489a-8e1e-9fe509d307ec" />
Review the visual matches and note any geographic indicators.
One of the top search results includes the reference “Bled Island (Slovenia)”, featuring a small island with a church and surrounding mountains—strong indicators consistent with the challenge image.

**Step 2: Location Verification in Google Earth**
<img width="1888" height="951" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-25 102447" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f68409a-f467-473d-ac67-97e73e4313b1" />

Open Google Earth and search for Lake Bled, Slovenia.

Use the 3D terrain view to compare key elements in the landscape:

The central island with the Church in the middle

The five distinct structures visible on the island

The mountain ridges in the background

The curvature of the lake and nearby forested areas

These features match the elements observed in the challenge image.

**Step 3: Recreate Photo**

Use Street View to replicate the viewpoint:

Drag the Pegman onto accessible paths along the lakeside—especially near the boardwalk or castle side.

Adjust the camera (tilt, pan, zoom) until the perspective aligns with the challenge photo.

Confirm key visual matches:

Buildings on the island

Mountain silhouette

Relative perspective and alignment

The match is consistent even if Street View is positioned slightly lower or higher than the original camera angle.

**Final Answer: Lake Bled, Slovenia**
